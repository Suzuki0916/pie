This is just an example file structure for a Windows PHP module.

Note that NONE of the .dll and .pdb files here are actually binaries!

Given the PHP path of `C:\php\php.exe`:

 - `php_pie_test_ext-1.2.3-8.3-ts-vs16-x86_64.dll` should be installed to `C:\php\ext\php_pie_test_ext.dll`
 - `php_pie_test_ext-1.2.3-8.3-ts-vs16-x86_64.pdb` should be installed to `C:\php\ext\php_pie_test_ext.pdb`
 - `supporting-library.dll` should be installed to `C:\php\supporting-library.dll`
 - `README.md` should be installed to `C:\php\extras\pie_test_ext\README.md`
